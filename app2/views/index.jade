    p This platform provides an interactive web interface for exploring and analyzing the MovieLens dataset, which includes information on all the movies contained in the dataset. The project utilizes a Python script for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring compatibility with SQL databases and handling cases with missing information. We are using Docker containers to host both the frontend and the database backend, as well as making deployment straightforward and automated through a bash script.

    p  ## Features

    p  ### Movies

    p  - **Customization**: Users can toggle the visibility of columns to customize the display of movie information.
    p  - **Detailed View**: Clicking on a movie reveals additional details, such as the `movieId`, average rating, genres, and a distribution graph of its ratings. All ratings are displayed, including user ID, rating, and rating date.
